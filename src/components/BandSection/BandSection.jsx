                    Twenty One Pilots is an American band formed in 2009 in
                    Columbus, Ohio, by Tyler Joseph alongside former members
                    Nick Thomas and Chris Salih. The current lineup consists of
                    Tyler and Josh Dun, who joined in 2011. Their music blends
                    genres like alternative pop, hip-hop, rock, and electronic,
                    featuring profound lyrics that explore mental health, inner
                    struggles, and hope. Known for their emotional connection
                    with fans and versatile style, the band has achieved
                    worldwide acclaim. <br />
                    Their most notable albums include Vessel (2013), Blurryface
                    (2015), Trench (2018), and Scaled and Icy (2021). They have
                    also created a unique narrative universe, particularly in
                    Trench, where the Banditos fight against the oppressive
                    regime of Dema, a metaphor for internal battles. With their
                    cultural impact and high-energy live performances, Twenty
                    One Pilots has become a global phenomenon.
